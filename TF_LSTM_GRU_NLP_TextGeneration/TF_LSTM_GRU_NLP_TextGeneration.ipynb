roses\\nStopped to inhale, can\\'t even tell your nose is, stuffed\\nSo focused on the bright side\\nThen you floor the gas pedal\\nAnd hit the corner fast the more asserted\\nNever looking back\\nMay hit the curb\\nBut every day is a new learning curve as you\\nSteer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve\\nBut you have to\\nTo avert a disaster\\nLucky no permanent damage\\n\\'Cause

you\\'re seekin\\'\\nIt begins to seep in\\nThat\\'s the only thing keepin\\'\\nYou from leapin\\' off the motherfreakin\\' deep end\\nAnd I\\'m pullin\\' for you to push through this feeling\\nAnd with a little time that should do the healing\\nAnd by tomorrow\\nYou may even feel so good that you\\'re willing to forgive \\'em even after\\nAll the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building\\nAnd the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building\\nYou\\'re sealed in but you\\'re fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it\\nAnd as you climb up to the roof, you\\'re just chillin\\' you look down\\n\\'Cause you\\'re so over \\'em\\nYou could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling\\n\\nAs time passes\\nThings change every day\\nBut wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remain the same\\nBut tomorrow today\\'s going down in flames\\nThrow the match, set the past ablaze\\n\\nSo feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire\\nFrom the heat\\nExhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief\\nAnd as you say goodbye to the grief\\nIt\\'s like watching the walls melt in your prison cell\\nBut you\\'ve extinguished this

trying to give you the life that I never had\\nI can see you\\'re sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh\\nI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry\\n\\'Cause you\\'re scared, I ain\\'t there?\\nDaddy\\'s with you in your prayers\\nNo more crying, wipe them tears\\nDaddy\\'s here, no more nightmares\\nWe gon\\' pull together through it, we gon\\' do it\\nLainie Uncle\\'s

girls\\nLookin\\' puzzled, in a daze\\nI know it\\'s confusing you\\nDaddy\\'s always on the move, mamma\\'s always on the news\\nI try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems\\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\\nAll the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see\\nDaddy don\\'t want you to see but you see just as much as he did\\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\\nBut things have got so bad between us\\nI don\\'t see us ever being together ever again\\nLike we used to be when we was teenagers\\nBut then of course everything always happens for a reason\\nI guess it was never meant to be\\nBut it\\'s just something we have no control over and that\\'s what destiny is\\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to

mama\\'s gon\\' be alright\\n\\n(Ha)\\nIt\\'s funny\\nI remember back one year when daddy had no money\\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up\\nAnd stuck \\'em under the tree and said some of \\'em were from me\\n\\'Cause daddy couldn\\'t buy \\'em\\nI\\'ll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying\\n\\'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job\\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom\\nAnd at the time every house that we lived in\\nEither kept getting broken into and robbed\\nOr shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar\\nTryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\\nAlmost had a thousand dollars \\'til someone broke in and stole it\\nAnd I know it hurts so bad it broke your mamma\\'s heart\\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin\\' to fall apart\\nMom and dad was arguin\\' a lot so momma moved back\\nOn the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment\\nAnd dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\\nAnd that\\'s when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre\\nAnd flew you and momma out to see me\\nBut daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me\\nThen you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn\\'t like it\\nAnd you and Lainnie were too young to understand it\\nPapa was a rollin\\' stone, momma developed a habit\\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\\nI\\'m just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\\n\\'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\\nNow I\\'m sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing\\nLookin\\' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\\nTo see how much you both have grown, it\\'s almost like you\\'re sisters now\\nWow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy\\'s still here\\nLainnie I\\'m talkin\\' to you too, daddy\\'s still here\\nI like the sound of that, yeah\\nIt\\'s got a ring to it don\\'t it?\\nShh, mama\\'s only gone for the moment\\n\\nNow hush little baby, don\\'t you cry\\nEverything\\'s gonna be alright\\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\\nDaddy\\'s here to hold ya through the night\\nI know mommy\\'s not here right now and we don\\'t know why\\nWe fear how we feel inside\\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\\nBut I promise mama\\'s gon\\' be alright\\n\\nAnd if you ask me to\\nDaddy\\'s gonna buy you a mockingbird\\nI\\'mma give you the world\\nI\\'mma buy a diamond ring for you\\nI\\'mma sing for you\\nI\\'ll do anything for you to see you smile\\nAnd if that mockingbird don\\'t sing and that ring don\\'t shine\\nI\\'mma break that birdie\\'s neck\\nI\\'ll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\\nAnd make him eat every carat don\\'t fuck with dad (ha ha)[Kehlani:]\\nAshes blowing in the

me\\nYou just make me get so crazy.\\n\\nI go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic\\nOne minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex\\nYou make me crazy,\\nThe way we act\\nLike two maniacs in the sack\\nWe fuck like two jackrabbits\\nAnd maybe that\\'s a bad habit.\\n\\n\\'Cause the next day we\\'re right back at it\\nIn the same exact pattern\\nWhat the fuck is the matter with us?\\nWe can\\'t figure out if it\\'s lust or it\\'s love\\nWhat\\'s that that\\'s attracting us to each other?\\nThey say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.\\n\\nWhich would explain why you\\'re such a motherfucking bitch\\nBut I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today\\nBut you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you\\nJust \\'cause I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you.\\n\\nBut if there\\'s one thing about you that I admire it\\'s, baby,\\nBecause you stay with me, maybe, because you\\'re as crazy as I am\\n\\'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes\\nBut if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side.\\n\\nLike a devil in disguise,\\nYou\\'re always full of surprises\\nAlways pullin\\' devices\\nOut your purse: little vibrators and dildoes\\nYou fucked yourself so much\\nYou barely feel those anymore\\nYou\\'re only twenty-four but you\\'re plenty more mature\\nThan those other little hoes\\nWho just act like little girls\\nLike they\\'re in middle school still\\nYou\\'re crazy sexy cool,\\n\\nChilling you play your position\\nYou never step out of line\\nEven though I stay in your business\\nYou\\'ve always kept out of mine.\\n\\nI wonder what\\'s on your mind\\nSometimes they say love is blind\\nMaybe that\\'s why the first time I dotted your eye\\nYou ain\\'t see the sign.\\n\\nOr maybe you did\\nMaybe you like being shoved\\nMaybe \\'cause we\\'re crazy in love\\n\\nCrazy on you\\nCrazy on you\\nLet me go crazy crazy on you\\n\\nYou are the ink to my paper\\nWhat my pen is to my pad\\nThe moral, the very fiber\\nThe whole substance to my rap.\\n\\nYou are my reason for being\\nThe meaning of my existence\\nIf it wasn\\'t for you\\nI would never be able to spit this\\nAs intense as I do and the irony\\nIs you rely on me as much\\nAs I rely on you to inspire me like you do.\\n\\nYou provide me the lighter fluid\\nYou\\'re fuel to my fire\\nYou\\'re my entire supply\\nGas, the match and igniter.\\n\\nThe only way that I am able\\nTo stay so stable\\nIs you\\'re the legs to my table\\nIf you were to break I\\'d fall on my face.\\n\\nBut I\\'m always gonna make you feel\\nI don\\'t need you as much as I really need you\\nSo you don\\'t use it to your advantage.\\n\\nBut you\\'re essential to me\\nYou\\'re the air I breathe\\nI believe if you ever leave me\\nI\\'d probably have no reason to be.\\n\\nYou are the Kim to my Marshall\\nYou\\'re the Slim to my Shady\\nThe Dre to my Eminem\\nThe Alaina to my Hailie.\\n\\nYou are the word that I\\'m looking for when\\nI\\'m trying to describe how I feel inside\\nAnd the right one just won\\'t come to my mind.\\n\\nYou\\'re like the pillar that props me up\\nThe beam that supports me\\nThe bitch who never took half,\\nThe wife who never divorced me.\\n\\nYou\\'re like the root to my evil\\nYou let my devil come out me\\nYou let me beat the shit out you\\nBefore you beat the shit out me.\\n\\nAnd no matter how much\\nToo much is never enough\\nMaybe \\'cause we\\'re crazy in love\\n\\nCrazy on you\\nCrazy on you\\nLet me go crazy crazy on youI

my thoughts\\nAll I can hear is drama with mom and him\\nI can always hear \\'em arguin\\' down the hallways\\nThe walls are thin so the noise is startin\\' to feel like the norm\\nMy dog pissed on

light on\\nBut he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him\\nHickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times\\nHe swatted me with it, I\\'m cryin\\'\\nHe just started hittin\\' me harder\\nGod, I wish I could just jaw him\\nIf I could get my weight up\\nBut I\\'m just a second grader\\nThis prick is bigger than I am\\nBut I\\'ve been readin\\' at school about this

I\\'m tryin\\' to get this bitch to fly off\\nThe hand\\'ll wait for the fist to fly off to put this guy in a pine box\\nHe\\'s always lookin\\' for chaos but tonight I\\'ve cooked up a plan\\nSo this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons\\nI\\'m layin\\' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin\\'\\nHe walks by, kicks my arm and goes \"Whoops\" and just laughs\\nI yelled for mom (Mom) and as she\\'s rushin\\' to my defense\\nI stood up and said, \"Fuck you punk\" and I took off and ran\\nTo my bedroom, as I fled\\nKnowin\\' shit would hit the fan\\nSlammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat\\nHe kicked it in\\nI swung it hard as I could at his head\\nHis noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed\\nI\\'m a little bit scared but my anger\\'s overtooken the fear\\nI threw down the bat and just started whoopin\\' his ass\\nBeat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain\\'t so bad\\n\"Ding-dong,\" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his\\nStomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two liter wein\\nThen buried him next to my dog\\nAnd if I go to juvie for this, I\\'ma tell \\'em\\n\\nI, I, hate\\nMy, my stepdad (Stepdad)\\nSo tonight I\\'m sayin\\', \"Bye-bye stepdad\" (Stepdad)\\n\\'Cause I, I, hate\\nMy, my stepdad (Stepdad)\\nSo tonight I\\'m sayin\\', \"Bye-bye stepdad\" (Stepdad)[Spoken

build\\nIt wasn\\'t my intentions, my intentions were good\\nI went through my whole career without ever mentionin\\'\\nAnd that was just out of respect for not runnin\\' my mouth\\nAnd talkin\\' about something that I knew nothing about\\nPlus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn\\'t my beef\\nSo I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth\\nWhile he\\'s all over t.v. down talkin\\' a man who literally saved my life\\nLike fuck it i understand this is business\\nAnd this shit just isn\\'t none of my business\\nBut still knowin\\' this shit could pop off at any minute cause\\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nThere used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme\\nAnd wouldn\\'t have to worry about one of your people dyin\\'\\nBut now it\\'s elevated cause once you put someone\\'s kids in it\\nThe shit gets escalated, it ain\\'t just words no more is it?\\nIt\\'s a different ball game, callin\\' names and you ain\\'t just rappin\\'\\nWe actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin\\'\\nMe and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\\nAnd asked him not to start it he wasn\\'t gonna go after him\\nUntil Ja started yappin\\' in magazines how we stabbed him\\nFuck it 50 smash \\'em, mash \\'em and let him have it\\nMeanwhile my attention is pullin\\' in other directions\\nSome receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\\nHas an erection for me and thinks that I\\'ll be his resurrection\\nTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\\nBut now he\\'s fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\\nWas through that publication the same one that made me famous\\nNow the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin\\'\\nWell fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then\\nBut I\\'m so busy being pissed off I don\\'t stop to think\\nThat we just inherited 50\\'s beef with Murder Inc.\\nAnd he\\'s inherited mine which is fine ain\\'t like either of us mind\\nWe still have soldiers that\\'s on the front line\\nThat\\'s willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders\\nNever to extort us, strictly to show they support us\\nWe\\'ll maybe shout \\'em out in a rap or up in a chorus\\nTo show them we love \\'em back and let \\'em know how important it is\\nTo have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners\\nTheir loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\\nBut I ain\\'t tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered\\nIt ain\\'t worth it, I can\\'t think of a perfecter way to word it\\nThen to just say that I love ya\\'ll too much to see the verdict\\nI\\'ll walk away from it all before I let it go any further\\nBut don\\'t get it twisted, it\\'s not a plea that I\\'m coppin\\'\\nI\\'m just willin\\' to be the bigger man\\nIf ya\\'ll can quit poppin\\' off at the jaws, well then I can\\nCause frankly I\\'m sick of talkin\\'\\nI\\'m not gonna let someone else\\'s coffin rest on my conscience cause\\n\\n[Chorus][Police voice:]\\nAttention all units,

got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed\\nSuited up head to toe in detective uniforms\\nOur unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors\\nLocking down every block and put up metal

last\\nFollowing footprints with a magnifying glass\\nTo drag his lying ass back to his padded cell\\nI\\'m mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail\\nI heard a yell the voice sounded familiar\\n\"Give me your girlfriend or I\\'m gonna kill ya\"\\n\\n[Chorus:]\\nI make you think you\\'re a backstabber\\nWhy I oughtta\\nHit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you\\'re a backstabber\\nWhy I oughtta\\nStay away from him he ain\\'t no good!\\n\\n[Verse 4:]\\nI followed the voice that led down a flight of steps\\nSneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs\\nInside the depths of his basement\\nI taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!\\nI saw my life flash in front of my eyes\\nI felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs\\nNone of my guys knew where I\\'m at I was doomed\\nThen I remembered the flashlight in my costume\\n\\n[Chorus:]\\nI make you think you\\'re a backstabber\\nWhy I oughtta\\nHit a bitch snake from the back, I make you

got your back turned\\nI yearned for the day that we finally met again\\nSo I can give him a taste of his own medicine\\nHe shed his skin, then he promised to come clean\\nI took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen\\nCut him at the seam then dragged the fella home\\nBeating him over the head with the telephone\\n\\n[Police voice:]\\nAttention all cars, attention all cars\\nUnit 313 has

was you niggas, I\\'d run while given the chance\\nUnderstand, I can enhance the spirit of man\\nDeath itself, it can\\'t hurt me\\nJust the thought of dying alone that really irks me\\nYou ain\\'t worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk\\nBe smart and stop tryna walk how Gs walk before we spark\\nHug the floor while we playing tug-of-war with your life\\nFuck a tour and a mic, I\\'d rather fuck a whore with a knife\\nDeliver that shit that coroners like\\nYou hype, popping shit in broad daylight\\nNigga, you\\'re a goner at night; when the music stops\\n\\n[Proof:]\\nInstigators turn pits in cages\\nLet loose and bit the neighbors; wrist to razors\\nY\\'all don\\'t want war, y\\'all want talk\\nIn the dark, my dogs all bark, like, \"Woof!\"\\nProof, nigga, I\\'m a wolf\\nGet your whole roof caved in, like reindeer hoofs\\nStomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose\\nThe more y\\'all breathe, shit, the more I moves\\nIt\\'s Hill Street: this is hardcore Blues\\nPut a gun to rap, check in all our dues\\nOr make the news, bet you all y\\'all move\\nWhen the Uzi pop, you better drop, when the music stop\\n\\n[Bizarre:]\\nMusic has changed my life in so many ways\\nBrain\\'s

the back\\nM.O.P. had me grimey and gritty\\nMarilyn Manson: I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties\\nLudacris told me to throw them bows\\nNow I\\'m in the hospital with a broken nose\\nAnd a fractured elbow\\nVoices in my head, I\\'m going in shock\\nI\\'m reaching for the Glock, but the music stops\\n\\n[Bang][Eminem singing]\\n\\nThere\\'s an intruder\\nin my house\\nHe cut my

think you do, but you do\\nEvery time I think of you I puke\\n\\nI was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem\\nBut off of the dome would probably be a little more, more suitable for this type of song--whoa\\nI got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of\\nSixteen bars, this ain\\'t enough to put some ink ta\\nSo fuck it, I\\'ma start right here I\\'ll just be brief I\\'m\\nBout to rattle off some of the reasons\\nI knew I shouldn\\'t go and get another tattoo of you\\nOn my arm, but what do I go and do\\nI go and get another one, now I got two\\nOoh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh\\nNow I\\'m sittin\\' here with your name on my skin\\nI can\\'t believe I went and did this stupid shit again\\nMy next girlfriend, now her name\\'s gotta be

know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa\\nYou may not think you do, but you do\\nEvery time I think of you I puke\\n\\nI was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter\\nBut I thought a song would probably be a little better\\nInstead of a letter\\nThat you\\'d probably just shred up--yeah\\nI stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of\\nHow much of a waste it\\'d be for me to put some ink ta, a stupid piece a\\nPaper, I\\'d rather let you see how\\nMuch I fuckin\\' hate you in a freestyle\\nYou\\'re a fuckin\\' coke-head slut, I hope you fuckin\\' die\\nI hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye\\nI hate your fuckin\\' guts, you fuckin\\' slut, I hope you die\\nDi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie\\nBut please don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not bitter or mad\\nIt\\'s not that I still love you, it\\'s not \\'cause I want you back\\nIt\\'s just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna\\nGag-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag\\nWhat else can I do, I haven\\'t got a clue\\nNow I guess I\\'ll just move on, I have no choice but to\\nBut every time I think of you now all I wanna do\\nIs pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nYou don\\'t know how sick you make

nervous wreck\\nI deserve respect; but I work a sweat for this worthless check\\n\\'Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt\\nMinimum wage got my adrenaline caged\\nFull of venom and rage\\nEspecially when I\\'m engaged\\nAnd my daughter\\'s down to her last diaper\\nThat\\'s got my ass hyper\\nI pray that god answers, maybe I\\'ll ask nicer\\nWatching ballers while they\\'re flossing in their pathfinders\\nThese overnight stars becoming autograph signers\\nWe all long to blow up and leave the past behind us\\nAlong with the small fry\\'s and average half pinters\\nWhile player haters turn bitch like they have vaginas\\n\\'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us\\nMoney\\'ll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless\\nWhile snakes slither in the grass spineless\\n\\n[Chorus (2x):]\\nThat\\'s Rock Bottom\\nWhen this life makes you\\'re mad enough to kill\\nThat\\'s Rock Bottom\\nWhen you want something bad enough to steal\\nThat\\'s Rock Bottom\\nWhen you feel like you\\'ve had it up to here\\n\\'Cause you\\'re mad enough to scream but you\\'re sad enough to tear\\n\\n[Verse Two:]\\nMy life is full of empty promises\\nAnd broken dreams\\nI\\'m hoping things will look up\\nBut there ain\\'t no job openings\\nI feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished\\nLiving in this house with no furnace, unfurnished\\nAnd I\\'m sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay\\nAnd I\\'m tired of being hired and fired the same day\\nBut fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play\\n\\'Cause when we die we know we\\'re all going the same way\\nIt\\'s cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan\\nWhen all you need is bucks to be the man\\nPlus a luxury sedan\\nToo comfortable and roomy in a six\\nBut they threw me in the mix\\nWith all these gloomy lunatics\\nWho walk around depressed\\nAnd smoke a pound of ses a day\\nAnd yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today\\nMy daughter wants to throw the ball but I\\'m too stressed to play\\nLive half my life and throw the rest away\\n\\n[Chorus]\\n\\nThere\\'s people that love me and people that hate me (yup)\\nBut it\\'s the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady\\nI want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame\\nThat means I\\'ll end up burning in hell scorching in flames\\nThat means I\\'m stealing your checkbook and forging your name\\nThere\\'s lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain\\n\\'Cause right now I feel like I\\'ve just hit the rock bottom\\nI got problems now everybody on my blocks got \\'em (I\\'m done)\\nI\\'m screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot \\'em\\nHolding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on \\'em\\nMy daughter\\'s feet ain\\'t got no shoes or socks on \\'em\\nAnd the rings you\\'re wearing look like they got a few rocks on \\'em\\nAnd while you flaunt \\'em I could be taking them to shops to pawn them\\nI got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want \\'em?\\n\\'Cause I never went gold off one song\\nI\\'m running up on someone\\'s lawn with guns drawn\\n\\n[Chorus]What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough. If you will to be\\nSaved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should\\nMove up a little bit from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better\\n\\nAll right, come on, let\\'s cut the bullshit enough\\nLet\\'s get it started, let\\'s start addressing this issue and open it up\\nLet\\'s take this shit back to the basement\\nAnd we can discuss statements that\\'s made on this tape\\nAnd its whole origin of the music that we all know and love\\nThe music we all enjoy\\nThe music you accuse me of tryna destroy\\nLet\\'s rewind it to \\'89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit\\nCrossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory\\nI\\'d like to share a story, this is my story and can\\'t nobody tell it for me\\nYou have well informed me, I am well aware that I don\\'t belong here\\nYou\\'ve made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere\\nFrom Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there\\nFrom the black side all the way to the white side\\nOK there\\'s a bright side a day that I might slide\\nYou may call it a pass I call it hauling my ass\\nThrough that patch of grass over them railroad tracks\\nOh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks\\nThem good old notorious so well-known tracks\\n\\nSo let\\'s go back\\nFollow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode\\nJourney with me as I take you through this nifty little place\\nThat I once used to call home sweet home\\n\\nCome on let\\'s go back\\nFollow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode\\nJourney with me as I take you through this nifty little place\\nThat I once used to call home sweet home\\n\\nI\\'d roam the streets so much they\\'d call me a drifter\\nSometimes I\\'d stick up a thumb just to hitchhike\\nJust to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke\\nAnd steal a god damn bike from somebody\\'s backyard\\nAnd drop it off at the park that was the half-way mark\\nTo meet Kim had to walk back to her mama\\'s on Chalmers after dark\\nTo sneak me in the house when I\\'m kicked out my mom\\'s\\nThat\\'s about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps\\nAt Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doing some talent shows\\nAt Center Line High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime\\nHe looked at me like I\\'m out my mind shook his head like, \"White boys don\\'t know how to rhyme.\"\\nI spit out a line and rhymed \"birthday\" with \"first place\"\\nAnd we both had the same rhymes that sound alike\\nWe was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit where compound syllables

the stress\\nAnd hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed\\nAlways groping a mess, of flying over the nest\\nTo selling dope with the rest\\nI quit smoking cess to open my chest\\nLife is stressful inside this cesspool \\nTrying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel\\nMy little brother\\'s trying to learn his mathematics\\nHe\\'s asthmatic, running home from school away from crack
